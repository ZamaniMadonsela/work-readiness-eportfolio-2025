# Reflection: Personality Assessment (STAR)

**Situation**: During the Work Readiness program, I was encouraged to complete a personality assessment to understand how my traits influence my learning and working style.

**Task**: I needed to evaluate my results and reflect on how they align with my career goals and personal development.

**Action**: I completed the 16Personalities test and was identified as an **INFJ-T (Advocate)**. I reviewed each trait in detail, including being introverted, intuitive, feeling-driven, and structured. I reflected on how these traits influence my role as an aspiring app developer who prefers meaningful, well-planned projects with real-world impact.

**Result**: The personality insights helped me recognize how I can use my empathy, imagination, and structure to succeed in IT. I now feel more confident in the direction of my career and more aware of the kind of environments where I can thrive.

# Reflect

Looking back at the artefacts, I can see how much I’ve grown. I’ve gained skills in communication, planning, time management, and teamwork. I also learned how to present myself professionally.

These experiences have helped me build confidence and understand what it takes to succeed in a job.
