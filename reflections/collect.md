# Reflection: 

**Situation**: I participated in the Work Readiness Program, where I was introduced to career counseling and personal development.

**Task**: My goal was to gather artefacts from my learning journey.

**Action**: I saved copies of my CV, presentation video, group project, and my reflections.

**Result**: I now have a well-organized collection of work that demonstrates my learning and development.


# Collect

I collected documents and materials from my classes and experiences. These include my resume, group project reports, presentations, and skills I developed during the work readiness training.

All of these artefacts help to show how much I’ve learned over time and how I’ve prepared for the working world.
