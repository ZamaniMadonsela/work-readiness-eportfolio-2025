# Reflection: 

**Situation**: I had to choose which artefacts best represented my growth.

**Task**: Evaluate my work and decide which pieces best show my skills and progress.

**Action**: I selected my group report, final CV, and interview reflection as my key evidence.

**Result**: These pieces clearly demonstrate my communication, teamwork, and professional skills.


# Select

I selected the most important artefacts that best show my learning and growth. For example, my resume shows my professional journey, and the group project shows how I can work in a team and solve problems.

These artefacts give a full picture of who I am and what Iâ€™ve achieved.
