## Personality Assessment

I completed the 16Personalities test and was identified as an **Advocate (INFJ-T)**. Advocates are described as quiet visionaries who are idealistic, imaginative, and guided by a strong sense of purpose. According to my results:

- I am **51% Introverted**, meaning I tend to be reflective and reserved.
- I am **61% Intuitive**, which means I focus on ideas and future possibilities.
- I am **72% Feeling**, indicating I make decisions based on values and emotions.
- I am **74% Judging**, showing I prefer structure and planning.
- I am **53% Turbulent**, meaning I may be self-conscious and sensitive to stress.

These traits help me in my IT career by allowing me to focus deeply on creative solutions, work independently and with empathy on team projects, and remain organized and committed to high standards in my coding and app development work.
